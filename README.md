# Lab 1.8 RandomDrills

## Instructions

Complete each of the methods in WhileDrills.java so that they do what their comments say they should do.

Write code in the main method to test your methods as you complete them. It is recommended that you write one method, test it, fix it, then move on to another method.

You will be using the Math.random method to solve these problems

```
double r = Math.random();
```

```
int r = (int)(Math.random() * howMany) + startingFrom;
```

For some of these problems you will be asked to **do something 100 times**. You can solve that problem with a while loop and a counter variable like this:

```
int iter = 0;
while(iter < 100)
{
  // do something here

  iter++;
}
```

Your code must meet the following restrictions:

*  Do not use any of these methods to solve other methods.
*  Do not create any other methods to solve these methods.
*  Do not change the method headers (return type, name, parameters) of these methods.
*  Do not delete the comments from the starter code

Remember that comments describe the method that comes after them.

## Testing

Write code in the main method to call your methods with different arguments and output the results. Test each method as you write it.

## Grading

You must *correctly complete at least 5* of these methods to pass this lab. If you correctly complete *all* of these methods, then you will earn 1 Above & Beyond point.

These methods will be inspected by the teacher for correctness.
